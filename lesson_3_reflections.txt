When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    in case of working in a team
    to take backup of local work so as to not loose it in case of local hard drive crash

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    since there could be a case where i have done partial local commits which i do not want to be publicly available yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    forks is a GitHub concept of cloning repository in GitHub machine
    clone is copying of the whole repository and creating a new one from it
    branch is working on an existing repository with various check points
    will use fork when copying over from some one else
    will use clone to copy from GitHub or when working on say a new version of the feature
    will use branch for working locally on various separate features

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    it helps us know if we have local commits not present in remote repo

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    A shared location with a locking mechanism where only one person can do changes at a time
    Hard to have multiple people working together
    Easy to manage single person very small project not requiring commit history
