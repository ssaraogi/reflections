When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    in case of working in a team
    to take backup of local work so as to not loose it in case of local hard drive crash

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    since there could be a case where i have done partial local commits which i do not want to be publicly available yet
